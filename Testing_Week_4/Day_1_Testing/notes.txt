E2E - workflow from beginning to end
integration - test a whole subsystem
unit test - small code piece

unit -> integration -> E2E
smallest pieces -> biggest pieces

Unit:
- individual unit/part/module
- not connection of others
- dev dependent, not used in live (not packaged for prod)
-- dev dependency = application only needs during dev, such as PyTest import'


naming convention test_NAME.py for file, for functions test_FUNCTION_NAME()
